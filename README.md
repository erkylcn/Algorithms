# leetcode solutions

This repository contains all of my solutions to the problems listed in leetcode.com.
I think some of my solutions are not the most efficient way of solving that problem. At least leetcode statistics says like that.
You can matcth the .java file name under solutions package with the name of problem listed in leetcode.com.

Maybe I add some test cases for the solutions.
